          The job of the management is not to see the organization as it is, but
          as it can grow to be. We believe in our ability to guide the forces of
          change and forge ahead to emerge as leaders in the areas of our
          operations. But, it is the employees of Neeraj Bhagat & Co. (Firm of
          Chartered Accountants) who will make the ultimate difference with
          services like Accounting services, general accounting services,
          financial accounting services, auditing services.Their dedication,
          energy, inventiveness and professionalism, we believe will optimize
          our business portfolio to unleash growth in the years ahead.We at NBC,
          believe that the essence of Services Excellence will always be
          dictated by a self-assessment system, which keeps quality and clients
          at the centre of all activities. Because of the ongoing changes within
          the accounting industry, NBC encourages staff members to select
          periodic professional education courses which broaden technical
          capabilities within the firm and enhance professional development of
          the individuals. We believe in instilling global competencies and
          value systems that foster teamwork, continuous improvement in services
          quality and customer relations, and providing a stimulating work
          environment. Empowering employees to progress, by providing the
          necessary skills through training, has ensured that NBC attracts and
          retains talent.
